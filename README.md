### Reflections and Comments
This was a great exersize and I think I was able to complete each element correctly. It was nice to see it all come together and gain the practice.

Lab 03 was definintely much more challenging and took a lot of time to figure out the details, but I am happy with the results and glad I was able to meet all of the requirements.
