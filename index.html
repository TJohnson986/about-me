            <p>
                Hey! I'm Tyler and I've lived in the PNW for forever. I've been in IT for a while, and am hoping to use the experiences I've gained in various roles so far to help me first learn to code but then also apply the people skills, technical skills and PM skills to a coding career. My breathtakingly beautiful wife and legtily adorable kids are my whole world.

            <h1>My Goals</h1>
            <p>
                My near goals are to complete the CodeFellows courses and land a job that I love and is flexible enough for me to find a better work/life balance. Ultimately my family and I would love to travel full time doing what we love, being together and exploring new places. I need a flexible and remote job to do so!
